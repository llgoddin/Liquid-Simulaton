# Liquid-Simulaton

The goal of this project is to simulate liquids using a technique called Smoothed-Particle Hydrodynamics using python

## Motivation

I created this project to practice implimenting physics in code.

## Status

Under Development

## Features

- Gravity
- Particle Repulsion
- Adjustable Container

## Controls

- Buttons are used to control various effects such as gravity, repulsion force, ect.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install dependencies found in requirements.txt.
Follow the instructions below to set up your virtual enviornment:

1. Create the virtual environment using python3's venv command

   > $python3 -m venv /example/path/destination/.env

   - Make sure to include /venv at the end in order to package the environment in a single directory

2. Navigate to the directory containing /.env
   > $cd /example/path/destination
3. Activate the virtual environment by calling the 'activate' script
   Mac/Linux:

   > $source .env/bin/activate

   Windows:

   > C:\\..\destination> .env\\bin\\activate.bat

4. Install dependencies using the included requirements file

   > $pip install -r requirements.txt

5. Run Graphics.py
   > $python3 Graphics.py
